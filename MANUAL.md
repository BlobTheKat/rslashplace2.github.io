# Rplace.tk custom server manual.

## Preramble:
Setting up a custom server that users can connect to (usually with the server switch menu, under the key combination shift+s) is admittedly not an easy feat *and would only be recommended for those with moderate knowledge in development with node and javascript*, however, provided you follow the rules outlined in  the[README](./README.md), this guide will help you along the way of setting up a shiny custom rplace server, with whatever canvas, chat or cooldown rules you like!

### Important notes:
 - To run a rplace custom server, you require:
    * Acess to a `server` or `PC` capable of running node. 
    * Some `knowledge in computing` and the use of node/javascript
    * Acess to your/your server's `port forwarding` rules in order to connect your custom server to the internet
    * A `web domain` for https connections [will be outlined later in this document]
 - If you intend to use a windows or macos host, a virtual machine must be used if you do not intend to having to make modifications to many parts of the server, as the server has only been designed to run on `linux`.
 - If you encounter a bug, please ask us on the discord or submit a github issue.
 - Make sure that you are running the latest versions of runtimes and libraries, such as the latest node.js, or you may encounter issues.
 - Read the instructions *carefully*, if something seems like common sense, you are probably doi
ng it wrong and will mess up the process further down the line.
